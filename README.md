# DevSpace
This is the website used for the DevSpace Technical Conference in Huntsville, Alabama.

The project is a .Net WebAPI project.

The website itself uses SSI for templating. I have the SSI processor running on the standard html pages, so note the special line added to the web.config to add this.
