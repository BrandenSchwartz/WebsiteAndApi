Multitouch, connectivity, GPS, battery conservation, accelerometer, less compute power, small screen size and a less than pixel accurate pointing device are just a few of the challenges developers face.  Oh yeah, mobile apps need to work on multiple platforms.  Instead of learning multiple languages and tools, just use Xamarin.  Xamarin allows .NET developers to target iOS, Android MacOS and more sharing up to 70% of code between platforms.  That's code that only needs to be designed, written, tested and deployed once.  Xamarin tools work across platforms with Xamarin Studio on macOS and Visual Studio on Windows.  It also integrates very well with cloud services such as Azure and devops services like Visual Studio Teams Services.  This session will be a survey of what the Xamarin platform offers and how you can take advantage of it.","Speaker":"Douglas Starnes","Tags":["Azure","C#","F#","Intermediate","Mobile","Visual Studio","Xamarin"]},{"Title":"A Whirlwind Tour of Django","Abstract":"Django is a leading web development framework written in Python, and has long been billed as \"the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines\".<br/><br/>This talk will quickly walk you through a typical django project, illustrating some of django's \"batteries included\" features and some common conventions used in many apps.

With the release of Lift 3.1, you can! Where Scala.js delivers on the promise of pure Scala, Lift 3.1 can deliver the same but without burdening the browser with large code downloads. Unlike with client-side rendering where the application needs a minimum of three round trips to the server before page load is complete, server-side rendering can load pre-rendered HTML immediately.<br/><br/>In previous versions of Lift, the developer must hand-write JavaScript or use a framework to achieve dynamic views. Now virtual-DOM diffing has been added to Lift’s powerful, secure framework allowing you to only write enough code to render application state into a page. In this way, you keep your application code purely functional without writing routines that mutate the state of the DOM. Not only is the burden on the browser lighter, but also by only updating the DOM after changes are committed on the server, the user learns to trust the application actually did what the user sees.","Speaker":"Britany Meadows","Tags":["Functional Programming","Web"]},{"Title":"High Class PowerShell: Objects and Classes in PowerShell","Abstract":"In this session we will focus on the ability to create custom objects in PowerShell, covering PowerShell versions 3 to 5.

A typical worker in the United States switches jobs every 4-5 years; in the tech industry stays are even shorter. Due to this software developers are guaranteed both to work on someone else’s code and someone will work on our code.  To survive, it is critical you continue to add value by improving the quality of the code you write and/or maintain in your job as a software developer.  In this session, we will define what it means to improve the quality of the code and give you practical steps towards improving it every day.","Speaker":"Paul Gower","Tags":["Beginner","Clean Code","Intermediate"]}]
