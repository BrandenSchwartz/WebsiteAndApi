While this is a myth, it is true a large percentage of people only live up to a small percentage of their potential. Much of the failure to achieve is due to limiting beliefs and unchallenged biases.\n\nYou live in a box. The box protects you from the outside world, but it also limits your potential. False beliefs and biases shape your life, throwing roadblocks on your success. But you have the power to break free from your box and live the life you desire.

Furthermore, consumers do want their data to be secure independent of the transport.\nIn 2009, Van Jacobson, author of TCP congestion control which helped saved the Internet from congestion, delivered a talk to PARC about a new type of Internet architecture known as Content Centric Network (CCN). Named Data Networking (NDN) was developed with NSF funding based on CCN.

I can count on TWO FINGERS the number of them that had repeatable database tests.  Even the most ardent Agile/Scrum/pick-your-new-and-shiny-development-mantra shops hardly ever do anything more than wave a magic wand at testing the database, because it can be REALLY HARD to do and do correctly.  In this session we will cover examples of why repeatable database testing is CRITICALLY important and then examine both a free and a low-cost commercial product to ease the pain and improve developer efficiency.","Speaker":"TheSQLGuru","Tags":["Intermediate","Testing","SQLServer"]},{"Title":"Building A Developer Community In Your Workplace","Abstract":"Development communities are growing like crazy.  In any given city, you have meetups, hackathons, conferences, and so much more.  This is great for expanding knowledge after work hours, but how about inside your workplace?  There�s a wealth of wisdom among your colleagues, just waiting to be shared.  In this talk, we�ll learn different initiatives you can take to create a community-oriented environment.  We�ll cover different ways to collaborate, share information, and write code that influence your very own workplace community.","Speaker":"Pat Viafore","Tags":["Soft Skills","Personal Growth","Culture","Community"]},{"Title":"Finishing Your Unity Game","Abstract":"For game jammers and hobbyist devs, the process of releasing a game may seem like an afterthought compared to designing and building it--right up until you realize everything you need to do before you can finally click \"Build\" or \"Submit\". This session will cover the easy-to-forget steps and last-minute decisions so you can plan ahead.","Speaker":"Dylan Wolf","Tags":["Intermediate","Mobile","GameDev","Unity"]},{"Title":"When Thermal Refactoring Isn't An Option: Triage, Salvage, and Duct Tape Engineering","Abstract":"Developers often find themselves on the maintenance end of inherited applications of variable quality. Sometimes features need to be implemented on aggressive timelines, at others a fix needs to go out immediately with very little wiggle room. Many developers are comfortable with greenfield projects but haven�t practiced the skills required to troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly, particularly when the applications involved are shining examples of antipatterns in the wild. This talk will focus on the mindset a developer needs to survive in a world of development gone wrong and encourage active discussion using real examples of �exceptional� code that�s best navigated with a strong stomach when burning it down and starting fresh is not an option.","Speaker":"Branden Schwartz","Tags":["Beginner","Intermediate","Life Hacks",".Net","SQLServer"]},{"Title":"Building a low-cost, scalable, and fault-tolerant web application in the Cloud using AWS","Abstract":"This talk will cover the architecture behind projects, as well as demonstrating some of the benefits of these cloud services.  Cloud hosting can provide �pay what you use� plan ideal for projects with low or variable budget needs that can easily scale in minutes.  Elastic and fault-tolerant systems can be designed for failure, so if one or more resource go down, the system can recover with little or no down time.  Services covered include S3, EC2, DynamoDb, Rds, Lamda,  Auto-scaling, and Cloudformation.","Speaker":"Chris Smeal","Tags":["Intermediate","DevOps","IoT","AWS","NETWORKING","Cloud"]},{"Title":"Android MVP - Understanding the Newest Android Design Pattern","Abstract":"Android, and mobile in general is a fast paced moving target. Things change, but no one knows what�s going on. We will discuss the newest pattern that the folks over at Google have adopted and will develop a simple app natively on Android while discussing the PROs and CONs of Android Patterns.\n\nWhile I live code an application on screen with everyone watching with the newest pattern for Android (MVP) I�ll discuss this pattern while discussing past patterns and where the Android platform is headed. Hopefully everyone can all learn a bit about Android, and where the mobile patterns are headed in general.\n\nCome see me while I take questions, talk, and code. I�ll be sweating bullets, making something fun and quick for everyone to enjoy while being entertaining. At least I hope so! If not, drinks are on me!","Speaker":"Andrew May","Tags":["Beginner","Best Practicies","Mobile","android"]},{"Title":"Getting Specific: Component Based Styling","Abstract":"With the introduction of modular javascript and powerful bundler like webpack the web has never been the same. Styling has long been debated, but finally with these advancements we can scope our styles at multiple levels. Equip yourself with the knowledge to make the right decisions.","Speaker":"Kyle Welch","Tags":["Beginner","Intermediate","Web","FrontEnd","Design"]},{"Title":"Closing Session","Abstract":"Join us as we close the Open Spaces, give away some door prizes, and give DevSpace 2017 a proper send off.","Speaker":"Chris Gardner","Tags":[]}]
