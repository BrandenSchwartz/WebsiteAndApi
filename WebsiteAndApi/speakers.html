			<h1>Call for Speakers FAQ</h1>
			<h2>What topics are you looking for?</h2>
			<p>
				We want DevSpace to be about community.
				The conversation is almost as important as the content.
				As such, we want speakers and attendees from every area.
				This shouldn't be limited to development technologies.
				Talks on testing, design, management, planning, personal improvement, and anything else you can think up will be accepted.
			</p>
			<h2>What incentives will I get as a speaker?</h2>
			<p>
				As a non-profit, there is not much I can offer.
				I will promise you a free ticket to the event.
				I will also offer you lunch and snacks.
				Unfortunately, that is all I can promise.
				If a sponsor steps up, I would like to have a speaker dinner, as well.
				Anything else will be decided by the remaining budget as we approach the event.
				Trust me, I will personally bend over backwards to do whatever I can.
			</p>
			<h2>What is the timeframe?</h2>
			<p>
				We plan on closing the call on or around June 24th.
				We hope to send out results on or around July 1st.
			</p>
			<h2>Why is the site so buggy?</h2>
			<p>
				This site is created for the community and by the community.
				We work on it, in the evenings, after a full day of coding at our day jobs.
				We try to test it on as many different platforms and browsers as possible.
				We don't have every device.
				We miss things.
				We are very tired.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you run into a small problem with the site, please let us know.
				You can always contact us at <a href="mailto:info@devpsaceconf.com">info@devspaceconf.com</a>.
				Furthermore, the entire code for the site is open sourced.
				Feel free to fork the code and submit a pull request.
				The code is on <a href="https://github.com" target="gh">GitHub</a> at <a href="https://github.com/DevSpaceHuntsville/WebsiteAndApi" target="ghds">https://github.com/DevSpaceHuntsville/WebsiteAndApi</a>.

			<h2>Why doesn't my account from last year work?</h2>
			<p>
				With this year's rewrite, I changed the hashing algorithm used for your credentials.
				Unfortunately, this means I could not port the accounts over from last year.
				You will have to create a new account.
			</p>
			<h2>Why can't I just OAuth from my &lt;other place&gt; account?</h2>
			<p>
				We wanted to do that, but did not have time.
				Remember that comment about being very tired?
