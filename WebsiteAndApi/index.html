			<h1>What is DevSpace</h1>
			<p>
				DevSpace is an annual developer’s conference that takes place in Huntsville, Alabama.
				Fueled by extensive space and missile research and a vibrant, emerging start-up culture, Huntsville is a market poised and ready to burst onto the national stage.
			</p>
			<p>
				Technological interests run the gamut of every language.
				As such, DevSpace aims to cater to this entire atmosphere.
				DevSpace wants to offer talks on a variety of languages, offering attendees the ability to improve their skills within their daily technology of choice and the ability to become familiar with new technologies.
				Combine this with talks on soft skills and processes, DevSpace will provide an outstanding value to the attendees.
			</p>
			<p>
				DevSpace operates on a Friday and Saturday.
				We think this schedule will encourage employers to send their employees to the conference.
				The schedule is based on the idea of “Give a day, take a day.”
				Employers are more likely to give their staff a day from work, knowing the employee with give a day of their own, doubling their return on investment.

				He does front-end and server-side work in Python, PHP, and JavaScript.
				He is the Lead Developer and Head of Developer Culture at <a href="http://graphstory.com" target="gs">Graph Story</a>.
				He served as web lead and security researcher at <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu" target="CERIAS">The Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS) at Purdue University</a> for 9 years.

			</p>
			<p>
				Ed's current passion is raising mental health awareness in the tech community with his <a href="https://osmihelp.org" target="osmi">Open Sourcing Mental Illness</a> speaking campaign.
				He will share this passion with his keynote, titled "Stronger Than Fear: Mental Health in the Developer Community."
				His rough abstract for this talk follows below.
			</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				There is a crisis in the tech industry.
				At least 20% of our colleagues, friends, and teammates suffer silently with mental illness, but our work culture does little to help.
				Based on real data, we'll show the enormous impact of mental illness in our industry, and how we can change – and save – lives.
