			<h1>What is DevSpace</h1>
			<p>
				DevSpace is an annual developer’s conference that takes place in Huntsville, Alabama.
				Fueled by extensive space and missile research and a vibrant, emerging start-up culture, Huntsville is a market poised and ready to burst onto the national stage.
			</p>
			<p>
				Technological interests run the gamut of every language.
				As such, DevSpace aims to cater to this entire atmosphere.
				DevSpace wants to offer talks on a variety of languages, offering attendees the ability to improve their skills within their daily technology of choice and the ability to become familiar with new technologies.
				Combine this with talks on soft skills and processes, DevSpace will provide an outstanding value to the attendees.
			</p>
			<p>
				DevSpace operates on a Friday and Saturday.
				We think this schedule will encourage employers to send their employees to the conference.
				The schedule is based on the idea of “Give a day, take a day.”
				Employers are more likely to give their staff a day from work, knowing the employee with give a day of their own, doubling their return on investment.

			<h1>Looking Ahead</h1>
			<p>
				We're beginning to look ahead to DevSpace 2017.
				I wanted to update everyone on a few things.
			</p>

			<h2>Ticket Prices</h2>
			<p>
				First, let's get the bad news out of the way.
				With a heavy heart, we have decided to raise the prices of tickets for this year.
				The new pricing structure will be as follows:
			</p>
			<table style="margin-left: 25px;">
				<tr>
					<td style="font-weight: bold; padding-right: 25px;">Super Early Bird Tickets</td>
					<td>$75</td>
					<td style="font-style: italic; padding-left: 25px;">Available until June 15th</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-weight: bold; padding-right: 25px;">Early Bird Tickets</td>
					<td>$100</td>
					<td style="font-style: italic; padding-left: 25px;">Available until August 1st</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-weight: bold; padding-right: 25px;">Standard Tickets</td>
					<td>$125</td>
					<td style="font-style: italic; padding-left: 25px;">Available until October 1st</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-weight: bold; padding-right: 25px;">Late Tickets</td>
					<td>$150</td>
					<td style="font-style: italic; padding-left: 25px;">Available until October 15th</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				We hope the increase in ticket prices will help us not lose thousands of dollars this year.
				We should have the ticket sales open soon.
			</p>

			<h2>Call for Speakers</h2>
			<p>
				Our call for speakers will begin on May 1st.
				It will run through the month on May, closing on May 31st at 11:59 PM CST.
				Of course, as always, 11:59 PM CST means until whenever I wake up on June 1st to flip the switch.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our goal is to select session and notify speakers no later than June 10th.
				Then, we hope to release the list of session no later than June 15th.
			</p>

			<h2>Session Lengths</h2>
			<p>
				After feedback from speakers last year, we are going to try something different this year.
				Speakers will be allowed to submit either 30 or 60 minute sessions.
				The number of each picked will be a function of the number of each type submitted.
				Ideally, we would like to have a track of 30 minutes sessions running both days.
