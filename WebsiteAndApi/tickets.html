			<h1>Tickets are available on EventBrite</h1>
			<p>
				DevSpace uses EventBrite for our tickets and PayPal as our payment processor.
				This gives you security you can trust.

			<h1>Ticket Types</h1>
			<p>
				There is no difference between the various ticket types.
				Each ticket will give you admittance to the conference, lunches, snacks, and swag.
				If our budget allows, we may also provide breakfast.
				You can get more details on that in the FAQ on the EventBrite page.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are currently offering a limited number of Super Early Bird Tickets.
				These tickets are going for the super affordable price of $50.
				These will be available until they either sell out or we start announcing  some details.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the Super Early bird tickets are gone, we will start selling Early Bird Tickets.
				These tickets are going for the not quite super affordable but still very affordable price of $75.
				These will be available until they either sell out or we announce  all the details.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the Early Bird tickets are gone, we will have standard tickets.
				They are so standard, I didn't even upper case the word ticket.
				These tickets are going for the not quite very affordable but still affordable price of $100.
			</p>
			<p>
				There will also be a limited number of Student Tickets.
				These tickets are going for the unbelievable price of $25.
				The catch is that you have to have a valid .edu email account to get one.
				Oh, and the fact that there are only 25 of them.
